#####  3 May 2018 - warrenf

This Node.js application calculates a savings account balance, given a fixed interest rate and annual deposits. Use this application to create an endpoint for the IBM API Connect gateway.

You can test a deployed copy of this API on IBM Cloud: https://savingsample.mybluemix.net

To build and run your own copy of the `savings` application:

1. Run `npm install`.
2. Start the LoopBack server with `npm start`.
3. Open http://localhost:3000/ to test the API operation.
